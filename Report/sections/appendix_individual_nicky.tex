\section{Appendix Individual Assignment 0740567}\label{app:indivnicky}
\textbf{One of Billâ€™s competitors has recently upgraded his truck fuel pumps to super-high- speed pumps, which can pump 250 liters per minute. Could you comment if it would be wise for Bill to invest in such pumps?}\\
\\
The average car pumps 50L at a rate of $40\frac{L}{minute}$, the average truck pumps 1000L at a rate of $130\frac{L}{minute}$. Then the average pumping times are 1:15 and 7:42 minutes respectively. If we look at the entire process without waiting, parking takes 30-45 seconds, driving away 10-30 seconds and paying 90 seconds to 4:30 minutes. The entire process then roughly takes 4:15 and 9:00s minutes respectively, of which the actual pumping takes 40\%/85\% of the time.\\
\\
Now consider we have pumps that have a fuel rate of $250\frac{L}{minute}$, of course only trucks are able to process this amount of fuel, trucks make up for 15\% of incoming vehicles. With this fuel rate it takes 4 minutes to refuel, the entire process now takes about 7 minutes, a reduction of 23\%.\\
\\
I think the advantage of upgrading the pump is too small to be worthwhile. Especially because it can only be used on trucks, and because of Bill's unusual setup of allowing trucks at every pump. Maybe Bill can upgrade only some of the pumps and add signs that these are for trucks. But in the end it comes down to the price of the upgrade.
