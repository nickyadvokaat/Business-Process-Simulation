\section{Appendix Individual Assignment 0758873}\label{app:indivramon}
First of all, some values within the model may have to be changed.
For example, the arrival rates of cars, trucks and cars with trailers may differ, depending on the country.
In fact, the given vehicle types may have to be changed altogether. \\
Additionally, the requirements for the fuel station may be altered.
In countries where the inhabitants are generally more laid back, the requirements regarding total time spent refueling can be lowered, which could allow for less cashiers on schedule, thus resulting in a more cost efficient fuel station. \\

Most of the changes stated above are altered rather easily in our model, by simply entering different values for the corresponding variables, it could be argued those aren't actual changes in the model at all.
However, some more invasive alterations may have to take place.
As of now, the model doesn't allow for easy adding or deleting lanes or cash registers, which may be needed, depending on the location. \\
Additionally, regulations may differ per country.
As stated in the assignment, fuel prices are fixed in Luxembourg, but they may not be in other countries.
The model could be extended to take into account the difference in arrival rates depending on fuel price, and calculate resulting changes on profit.
Moreover, fuel cost may differ for trucks and regular cars, or there may even be different types of fuel.
